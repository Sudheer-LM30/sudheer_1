CMAKE:

makefiles- it provides a build system which can be used to manage and clean the programs.
cmake- it is a cross platform makefile generator, it automatically generates the makefiles for our projects. 

TIMESTAMP:
*The main use of touch command is to access,change and modify the time of the file.
stat filename
cat filename(visits the filename)
echo "newline" >> filename(adds newdata to the file)
(change- it actually refers to which the metadata related to the file was changed like when the file permissions were changed (ls -l))
touch -a filename(add current time whenever we use the command(accessing))
touch -m filename(for modifying)
touch filename1 -r filename2(refer 1 with 2)
we cant change the timestamp for(change),(we can change by changing system time)
